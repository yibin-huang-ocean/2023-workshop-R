## Instructions for setting up
**Step 1: Download the One-Argo-R toolbox**

1. Source 1: Github [`Github`]([https://github.com/go-bgc/2023-workshop-python/blob/main/BGC_one_float_data.ipynb](https://github.com/NOAA-PMEL/OneArgo-R/tree/v1.0.1)) 

3. If needed, sign into your Google account. A standard, free, personal Google account is recommended, as not all institutional Google accounts allow Colab access to Google Drive.
4. In Google Colab, near the top menu bar, click on the button that says "Copy To Drive" ![Copy to Drive](img/2023-08-18-14-28-38.png)
